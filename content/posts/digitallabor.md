Most Americans are concerned about Artifical Intelligence. They often cite labor replacement, cyber security, geopolitical risks, information integrity, privacy and creepiness as reasons for their concern. People who are extremely concerned with the impacts of AI on our society are AI Doomers. Doomerism in AI can come in many forms, but for this piece I want to discuss one of the most frequently cited scenarios: Labor Replacement.

## The State of Discourse on Labor Replacement

Labor replacement is a way of formalizing the concern that AI systems will take current human jobs. For instance, an AI customer service bot taking away phone calls from human customer service agents reducing the need for humans. Losing a job is obviously painful and extremely disruptive to a person's life and I won't really expound on this any further. Much has been said on labor replacement, but most discussions of the material have been quick and shallow. For instance, some believe labor replacement concerns are unwarranted because AI will create more jobs than it replaces, all without explaining how. (sucks) Others posit that the concerns are justified due to supposed scaling laws of Generative AI models without a solid view for how a model turns into an application. My purpose is to discuss these considerations and offer some definitions to help frame future discussion.

## A Definition of Labor Replacement Conditions

For Generative AI or Traditional AI systems to replace labor it must satisfy certain conditions.

> 1.  Intelligence: The artificial intelligence must have the consistent ability to perform the labor correctly.

> 2. Integration: The system must be able to be easily integrated and scaled to the current job format.

> 3. Cost: The system must be able to do the labor cheaper or faster when considering the quality of intelligence.

> 4. Human Acceptance: The human population must generally accept the AI system's output as valuable, trustworthy, and not creepy.

If these four conditions are met I believe labor replacement concerns are highly valid. Lets consider a couple of examples to examine how current types of labor could be impacted.

## Example 1: Voiceover Actors

Voiceover actors are people who work by recording their voice for narrating movies, commericals, audiobooks and more. Now to consider the state of AI systems across these dimensions.

1. Intelligence: Modern Generative AI models are able to generate audio which is often indistinguishable from real human voices. There are some notable issues with AI models expressing emotion, laughing and certain pronouncations.

2. Integration: Voiceover actors typically lend their voice in a modular way which lends to a very easy integration process.

3. Cost: Most Generative AI audio systems are very cheap. Currently, best in class models can cost as low as $0.010 per min of spoken audio. Human voiceover actors cost $100-1000 per hour.

4. Human Acceptance: Most people have some general distaste for AI generated voices when compared to human voices. For certain types of content like voiceover for short videos the AI generated voice may be more acceptable than for a documentary or movie.

The verdict is current voiceover actor work is highly susceptible to labor replacement. The main push back currently is the human acceptance of AI voices in their content. We are likely to see a bifurcation in the voice over market where most labor becomes artificial and special boutique cases will remain human to accomodate the variation of acceptance.

## Example 2: Customer Service Representatives

Customer service representatives do a variety of different tasks. So for this example I am going to limit our analysis to the work of a typical call center representative. The labor consists of recieving phone calls, communicating clearly, following structured scripts, handling questions, process orders, refunds and account changes.

1. Intelligence: Current AI models are very well capable of chatting with humans. Current audio models can generate with a rapid latency to simulate real time conversation. AI models are decent at following insturctions and procedures with some challenges in specialized situations.

2. Integration: Embedding an AI system into a phone call or internet voice call is becoming trivial. To embed AI models to perform the actions of processing orders, refunds and account changes can be depend on the available interfaces for current representatives. It would be easy if there were well engineered APIs vs an outdated web-only user interface.

3. Cost: The current cost of building customer service AI systems is around 0.10 dollars per minute. With human representatives being paid 2 - 30$ per hour depending on country and experience.

4. Human Acceptance: _-/0\-_
