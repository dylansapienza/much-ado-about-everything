Most people would agree that doing things should be as easy as possible. Suppose you wanted to listen to some music. You could either:

1.  Go to a store, browse through a catalog of physical CDs. Purchase an album which costs about 20 dollars. Then put the CD into your player. Sit down and listen to the music. When you wanted to skip to a different album or artist, you'd have to stand up walk over press eject then replace the CD in its old case. Find the new CD, insert it and hit play.
2.  Reach into your pocket, grab your phone, tap your screen a few times and listen.

The level of _friction_ between these two scenarios is great. In the first one there is _time friction_, _monetary friction_ and _energy friction_. In the last one there is almost none. The _friction_ I am talking about here can be defined as:

> **Friction**: factors which prevent bringing your mental desire to physical reality.

In the second scenario, the gap between desire and fulfillment collapses to nearly nothing—your thought transforms into reality almost the instant it forms. There are different types of friction.

> **Monetary** Friction: When the monetary cost of do something makes something harder to do
> **Time** Friction: When the amount of time to do something makes it harder to do
> **Process** Friction: When the procedure to do [...] > **Energy** Friction: When the amount of energy to do [...]

Technology makes things easier to do. It removes friction. A common intuition is that making things easier to do is good. If asked which music listening scenario you'd prefer most would say the second. In fact, that is what we have seen in society. No one really listens to physical media anymore. Instead we've opted for digital streaming services. I contend that making things easier to do is not always good. Instead I am going to suggest that in some domains it is good up until a point where thereafter it becomes less-good.

At first reducing friction allows significant value increases until it reaches a tipping point. An apex of maximum point of value. After removing friction, surprisingly, reduces value.

## Why Does Friction and Value Work This Way?

In some cases the value or experience of doing a thing is affected with how easy it is to do. When you are unbounded to listen to any music, artist or song, at any moment, our relationship with what music is changes. Before, music was much more intentional. To listen meant you had to do a series of high friction activities. The willingness to endure the friction meant you really wanted to listen and you would be less likely to move on to something else. If I bought walked 20 minutes to the store, searched and purchased the latest Strokes album for 20 dollars, then brought it home to play, I am not as likely to just give up on it if I don't like it at first. I am, by way of friction, invested in it. This level of friction investment is absent in a world of zero-friction music streaming. The instant I cease to enjoy the album I am free to move on and listen to something else. When friction is reduced we see behaviors evolve to be much more nomadic, unfocused and erratic. Our will has the direct power to divert us at it each and every whim. When friction is present, your will has less power. "I bought this album, so I should give it a good shot, even if I'm not loving it right now." There's a way that our short-term will must relenting to the larger friction tested will. Imagine going through all the setup to take out your speakers and CD player. Plug them all in. Find the album of your choosing. Then insert it and hit play. The will needed to derail you from listening would be pretty significant.

Friction is **good** at giving us guardrails. It allows us to stay committed to a path and prevent deviations that get in the way of engaging deeply with something. In a world of decreasing friction, where it is easier to do whatever we want moment to moment, we are faced with a paradox: either we are paralyzed by choice or we jump rapidly thing to thing losing the real value we were looking for in the first place. This interplay between value and friction reveals a crucial insight: as activities become frictionless, they transform from meaningful experiences into mere commodities. What was once hard fought becomes instrumentalized, ubiquitous, and devalued. The ease of access doesn't just change how we obtain things—it fundamentally alters our relationship with them. So far I have applied friction to music listening, but this structure is pervasive across most aspects of our life. In relationships, we want them to be easy enough that we can go and meet people we like, form initial connections and proceed to deepen them. Modern digital dating apps have made finding people to connect with phenomenally easy. Yet we have find that real connections are even harder to cultivate. A very similar thing is also present in creating music. It is easier than ever to learn how to play an instrument an online, but that ease of entry comes at the cost of an ease of exit.

## A Middle Way

Let me be clear, reducing friction is and will continue to be a worthwhile pursuit. In most circumstances, we have not arrived to the "digital streaming moment" where we can make real our every whim. In some instances we can't even effectively enact our own long-term sustained will. My desire to have a prestigious and high-paying job is filled with friction. So much so that many people fail to do so even when they put a lot of time, money, and energy to. Friction functions to keep you where you are. When you want to leave your job but the friction of finding a new one is high, you are stuck there. Being stuck on the wrong end of friction is unpleasant. At the same time, always looking for the exit as soon as things get challenging is no way to live, especially when challenges await you where ever you go. How can we find the balance of friction where we can maximize value without diminishing our experience?

Behaviorally, we seek pleasure and we avoid pain. We follow this behavior scales big and small. Friction, in moderation, allows us to stay committed to pursing longer term goals in the face of moment to moment headwinds. Things should be easy, but not too easy.
